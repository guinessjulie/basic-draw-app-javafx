basic-draw-app-javafx
=====================
This is a JavaFX implementation of the basic draw MVC example. It uses JavaFX features like declarative layout, Shape tree nodes, and model-view property binding. Selection and drawing controllers are active simmultaneously (unlike in the Swing example)

The project requires Java 8 (it will not work properly in Java 7). 

In Eclipse, make sure that you have imported the project basic-draw-app-java-model first! 
Use Project Properties / Java Build Path / Libraries to put a Java 8 in the build path.
